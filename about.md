# Auto Sort Lists

This mod lets you auto sort lists based on certain criteria

Currently implemented:

- Stars
- Rating
- Level Name
- Author Name

It lacks advanced sorting options such as specifying multiple sorting method and orders but it's still a great help for simple use cases (or using as a starting point to further sort the list manually)

# Usage

In the list edit layer, there's a button added at the bottom right side.
<cr>Changes applied to a list can not be reverted, it's recommended to make a copy of the list before using the mod</c>
